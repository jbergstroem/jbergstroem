### Nice to meet!

I'm Johan BergstrÃ¶m â€“ a serial entrepreneur and geek born and raised in Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. Since my early 20's have built, learned from failures and sold various tech startups using my skills in software engineering. Along the way, I've met incredibly talented co-founders and co-workers. I currently live in Santiago, Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±.

After first embedding Spidermonkey in Python 2010 (cross-rendering John Resig's Micro Template), I've come to love the javascript ecosystem. I got involved in [Node.js][nodejs] in its early stages and became a core contributor, ultimately taking a seat on [the build infra team][nodejs-build].

I deeply enjoy engaging in open source; through code, discussions or conversations. Reach out!
