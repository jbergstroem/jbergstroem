### Nice to meet!

I'm Johan BergstrÃ¶m â€“ a serial entrepreneur and geek born and raised in Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. Since my early 20's have built, learned from failures and sold various tech startups using my skills in software engineering. Along the way, I've met incredibly talented co-founders and co-workers. I currently live in Santiago, Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± .

There is something fundamental about sharing your knowledge and thoughts with others through open source and its surroundings. Ever since embedding Spidermonkey in a Python project late 2000's, I've come to love the javascript ecosystem. I got involved in [Node.js][nodejs] in its early stages and became a core contributor, ultimately taking a seat on [the build infra team][nodejs-build]. While using open source software I tend to send patches upstream as I stumble upon issues, leading to contributing to 100+ (I lost count) projects.
